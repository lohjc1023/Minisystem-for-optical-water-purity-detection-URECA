Hi Daniel,

For Dowa, Hakuto is no longer distributing their products as updated from our HQ (Hakuto Japan) in 
Japan. 

For FireflySci, please let me check with them again and get confirmation on the customisation and also if 
they have any standards products similar to the image you have provided.

Regards,
Philip

                                             Dear Mr. Philip Ong,
               Thank you for your updates, although frankly I am rather puzzled by the answers from the 
companies which do not quite make sense, specifically:
 
1.	For DOWA, at WHICH exact product are they referring to?? I can’t believe that they don’t have 
ANY of those I indicated! You may remember that for DOWA I indicated that I was interested in 
the following devices:
o	UF1VL-1H321 & UF4VL-1H321
o	308-FL-02-G02 & 340-FL-02-G02
o	Do they have LEDs with emission at shorter wavelengths, e.g. 280 nm and 235 nm??
Attached you have their spec sheets and info for their products, so clearly I cannot possibly believe they 
are NOT producing the indicated devices. Maybe one but not all. So please kindly ask them again about 
the previously listed devices to provide a quotation, or -in case one of them is not produced to indicate 
their new device that replaces it. Even if they may not have some device, then they indicate the one 
closest in specs to the one9s) indicated.
2.	For FireFlySci, I am puzzled because in their website the clearly indicate that they CAN do 
customization. Anyway, in this case then can you please ask them if they can provide a 
quotation for an assembly similar to that shown in the photo (taken from their website!), i.e. for 
a quartz flow cell with mounted metal side flanges and the plastic connecting tubes? Just as 
previously, they can provide the costs for such a full arrangement in 2 cases, for the same flow 
cells indicated previously: 48UV10 & 501UV10
 
Thank you very much for your kind help!
               With best wishes,
               Daniel

Hi Daniel,
 
I am still following up on your request. The following updates for your reference.
 
Hamamatsu -> Screening process is still on-going.
Dowa -> Our Japan HQ have reverted and confirm that we have just recently stop carrying this product.
FireflySci -> They have reverted that they will not be able to do customisation.
 
Thank you.

                                             Dear Mr. Philip Ong,
               OK, sure, then we just wait for the reply from Japan and from Dowa.
 
               For the FireflySci:
*	I am afraid I don’t have any CAD sketch and don’t have any access to a CAD software. I already 
made them a drawing with outer dimensions included. As I clearly indicated in my text, the inner 
dimensions will depend on their standard wall thickness, so they can easily deduce the inner 
dimensions using that standard value. If they have already some existing standardized flow cell 
of similar dimensions close to our values then they can just use that even if the dimensions 
could be a bit different;
*	Likewise the coating was already indicated: UV enhanced Al mirror – this is the standard name 
used by almost all manufacturers worldwide (with some small variations). If it makes things 
easier, they can consider and quote for all 3 possible variations: 
A.	Quote just for the quartz flow cell with the necessary dimensions (or any standard 
they have closest to it) WITHOUT ANY coating; 
B.	Quote for the quartz flow cell coated on 3 sides with a standard UV enhanced Al 
mirror, which typically consists of just an Al layer covered usually by 1 or 2 thin 
layers that modify its reflectivity. The layer(s) is/are to ensure reflectivity R remains 
reasonably high at shorter wavelengths in UV, as well as protect the Al both against 
oxidation & scratching. For this I also told them the specifications: the reflectivity R 
should be more than (or at least equal with) 80% at the wavelength of 235 nm, and 
should be at least that high or even higher throughout the visible range, i.e. until at 
least 600 nm. Usually the reflectivity is higher after the UV region because fresh 
unoxidized Al itself has a pretty good reflectivity in the visible range (we are NOT 
interested in the IR region). Actually, FRESH BARE Al has a very good reflectivity in 
UV as well; see attached graph. You can see that R>90% for all wavelengths 
between 200 to 600 nm, which includes our range of interest. The CATCH is that this 
is only for FRESH BARE aluminum and does not remain like this because because Al 
which will slowly oxidize, resulting in a significant loss of reflectance in the UV, and 
slight scattering throughout the spectrum. Therefore, it is best if aluminum has a 
protective dielectric overcoat deposited in the same machine, in vacuum, 
immediately after the deposition of the Al layer. Typically this is obtained with a thin 
layer of SiO2 or other suitable/available dielectric, whose thickness has to be 
designed to optimize, i.e. increase (NOT decrease) the reflectivity or at least 
maintain it at the same level, especially in the UV part. Sometimes 2 such dielectric 
layers are used in order to achieve this increased/improved/maintained high 
reflectivity in UV and also for other roles as well (better optical matching with air, 
better protection against oxidations, against scratching, etc.)
    If FireflySci does have optical layer deposition equipment and optical coating 
specialists, I am sure they are familiar with how such a UV enhanced Al mirror can 
be realized.
   
C.	Quote for the quartz flow cell coated on 3 sides with a slightly modified mirror 
design. If FireflySci indeed does have optical layer deposition equipment and optical 
coating specialists, then it may be worth to ask them to realize a modified mirror 
design for the coating (see attached drawing). For the standard mirror, the topmost 
side has the high desired reflectivity, and the bottom side just sits on the substrate 
(quartz). However, for our application, it is best to have the highest reflectivity at 
the interface with the quartz, NOT with the air! This means that the light comes 
from the quartz side and also reflects back into the quartz!  In optical design terms, 
it means that for the optical design of our mirror the “substrate” is actually air, the 
1st layer is a thin SiO2 (or other dielectric) protective layer, followed by the Al layer, 
then the other layer(s) for enhanced reflectivity in UV-vis, and then finally the 
quartz, which in optical filter design terms is now the “exit medium”. If it is too 
difficult to achieve R>80% for all wavelengths above 235 nm up to 600 nm with 
normal incidence at the interface with the quartz (again, light is incident from the 
quartz side!) then it can be designed/optimized for another angle of incidence, e.g. 
45o. If the FireflySci has optical coating specialists who have available the optical 
data for quartz, Al and of their used dielectrics at many wavelengths in the range of 
interest and also have the necessary optical filter design software, then this design 
would not take more than 30min… 1hr at the most. When I was  a PhD I did have 
such a design software but unfortunately don’t have it anymore, but I know from 
experience that the design in itself is not difficult, especially if they are proffesionals 
who know already the standard solution for a typical UV enhanced Al mirror, and 
whose layer thicknesses and materials may need to be tweaked a bit to re-optimize 
for the new situation described above (air as “substrate” and quartz as “exit 
medium” from which light is incident and into which is reflected back).
               
Finally also thank you for all the info, but can you please re-forward all the info in S$ because otherwise 
it is not very useful, it is exactly the same as in the website(s). Actually for the EagleEye spectrometer 
from OtO why is your price indicated as USD7200 when on their website is USD6800? Likewise for the 
LS-DH source which is USD2410 on the website?
 
               Thank you very much once again and am looking forward for your feedback!
               Best wishes,       
Daniel

*	A custom-made flow cell, as shown in the drawing in the left attached image below. 
o	The dimensions are: L= 50 mm, W = 25 mm; H = 5?....8? mm. The wall thickness can be 
chosen as dictated by the fabrication considerations. The H value will probably also be 
dictated by manufacturing practical considerations, because the inside chamber will have 
a height h = H-2t, where t is the thickness of the quartz material which obviously cannot 
be reduced below a certain minimal value, which I am not sure what would be in their 
case: 1.5 mm? If we assume 1.5 mm to be indeed the minimal quartz wall thickness 
value then I believe that a minimal overall height of ~6…7 mm is feasible. As is shown in 
the drawing, ideally we would like 3 of the lateral walls (all of which normally would be 
smoothly polished and transparent) to be (after polishing) covered with an UV-enhanced 
Al coating which can serve as a good quality mirror for both most of the UV and visible 
ranges. For such mirrors usually the critical part is extending the reflectivity in the UV, 
hence the indicated value of minimal reflectivity for the coating of Rmin>80% @ the 
wavelength of 235 nm, because usually the reflectivity just gradually increases at larger 
wavelengths and remains relatively high throughout the visible range. The flow cell can 
be made either like a 501 type (i.e. with the inlet/outlet colinear with the flow cell itself), or 
as a 48 type (i.e. the inlet/outlet will be normal onto one facet, in this case obviously the 
non-covered facet, but in this case clearly the entire length of the cell will need to be 
increased to include the size necessary for the inlet & outlet themselves), which is 
considered to be best for manufacturing and assembly (see next). 
o	Finally, the price in the quotation should be for a final product that should include not just 
the custom flow cell but also its immediate fluidic connections to the inlet & outlet. In 
other words, it should look similar to the item shown in the right attached image below, 
i.e. it is better if they can do also do the coupling of inlet & outlet  to tubing themselves so 
that we do not damage them or the delicate quartz flow cell and we can easily use it 
directly and connect it to any other tubing as required (and this way the inlet/outlet are 
also better protected during shipping & subsequent handling). The dimensions (LWH) are 
not very critical. If it is considered that for handling and safety considerations -e.g. for 
proper subsequent polishing without breaking it apart, and/or to be able to properly screw 
tightly the metal connectors to the tubing at the end- at least one of the initial sizes needs 
to be modified (e.g. H needs to be increased, say to a minimal value of 9 mm), then sure, 
no problem.

                                             Dear Mr. Philip Ong,
               Thank you for your quick reply! I am a bit familiar with Hakuto, actually Mr. Gregory Quek may 
remember me from the past when I bothered him a few times for various quotations.
               Let me quickly address you questions. First, attached you have the filled in declaration file, with 
attached papers as required about clarifying the application/topic of our proposal. Second, as I also 
stated there, please allow me to highlight that at this moment I need only the cost 
information/quotation not a delivery of devices because I am working at the project proposal and I need 
to estimate the total budget. For this I need to compare not only the specs of various devices but also 
their costs in order to select the most suitable one(s) for the project, so right now the question of usage 
of the devices is irrelevant. IF the project will ultimately be approved, then of course the question of 
delivery will become relevant, and in that case certainly I will contact you once we will need device(s) to 
make the setup(s).
   The project proposal itself is about water quality assessment and monitoring using UV absorption as 
well as fluorescence.
 
- Quantity: The setup may need 2 detectors, one for UV absorption and one for fluorescence, but 
probably we may need to do a few versions of setups, so maybe a safer estimation of most probable 
need would be a possible order of 6 pieces. However, this will not be for ALL the devices I inquired 
about, but only for 2 or 3 of them which ultimately will be selected as optimal. Once the project will 
be approved and the design clarified, I will contact you again when delivery will be needed.
- Application:   Right now no application, only budget estimation for a project proposal. The 
project proposal itself is about water quality assessment and monitoring using UV 
absorption as well as fluorescence (see attached papers).

o	A custom-made flow cell, as shown in the drawing in the first attached jpg image. The 
dimensions are: L= 50 mm, W = 25 mm; H = 5?....8? mm. The wall thickness can be 
chosen as dictated by the fabrication considerations. The H value will probably also be 
dictated by manufacturing practical considerations, because the inside chamber will 
have a height h = H-2t, where t is the thickness of the quartz material which obviously 
cannot be reduced below a certain minimal value, which I am not sure what would be in 
their case: 1.5 mm? If we assume 1.5 mm to be indeed the minimal quartz wall 
thickness value then I believe that a minimal overall height of ~6…7 mm is feasible. As is 
shown in the drawing, ideally we would like 3 of the lateral walls (all of which normally 
would be smoothly polished and transparent) to be (after polishing) covered with an 
UV-enhanced Al coating which can serve as a good quality mirror for both most of the 
UV and visible ranges. For such mirrors usually the critical part is extending the 
reflectivity in the UV, hence the indicated value of minimal reflectivity for the coating of 
Rmin>80% @ the wavelength of 235 nm, because usually the reflectivity just gradually 
increases at larger wavelengths and remains relatively high throughout the visible 
range. The flow cell can be made either like a 501 type (i.e. with the inlet/outlet colinear 
with the flow cell itself), or as a 48 type (i.e. the inlet/outlet will be normal onto one 
facet, in this case obviously the non-covered facet, but in this case clearly the entire 
length of the cell will need to be increased to include the size necessary for the inlet & 
outlet themselves), which is considered to be best for manufacturing and assembly (see 
next). Finally, the price in the quotation should be for a final product that should include 
not just the custom flow cell but also its immediate fluidic connections to the inlet & 
outlet. In other words, it should look similar to the item shown in the last attached jpg 
image, i.e. it is better if they can do also do the coupling of inlet & outlet  to tubing 
themselves so that we do not damage them or the delicate quartz flow cell and we can 
easily use it directly and connect it to any other tubing as required (and this way the 
inlet/outlet are also better protected during shipping & subsequent handling). The 
dimensions (LWH) are not very critical. If it is considered that for handling and safety 
considerations -e.g. for proper subsequent polishing without breaking it apart, and/or to 
be able to properly screw tightly the metal connectors to the tubing at the end- at least 
one of the initial sizes needs to be modified (e.g. H needs to be increased, say to a 
minimal value of 9 mm), then sure, no problem.
6.	From DOWA: I would like to know the prices for the following devices:
o	UF1VL-1H321 & UF4VL-1H321
o	308-FL-02-G02 & 340-FL-02-G02
o	Do they have LEDs with emission at shorter wavelengths, e.g. 280 nm and 235 nm??
 
Thank you very much for you time and consideration and I am looking forward for your feedback!
               With best wishes,
               Daniel
