			Dear Lady/Sir,
	My name is Poenar Daniel and I am an Assoc. Prof. in the School of Electrical & Electronical Engineering (EEE) of the Nanyang Technology University (NTU), Singapore.
	I am now working on a project proposal for whose budget configuration I need to quickly gather quotations for the required materials & consumables. 
	I would like to ask you to please kindly provide me a quotation with the costs for the following products:
		UV-100EQC
		A5V-35UV
		APD50-8-150-TO8
		UDT-555UV
Please kindly also include in the quotation the cost of packaging & shipping.
               Thank you for your help and am looking forward for your quick feedback !
               With best wishes,
               Poenar Daniel
