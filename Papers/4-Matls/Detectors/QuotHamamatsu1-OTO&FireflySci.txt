Hi Daniel,

Thank you for sharing. Can I confirm if Professor S.A. Synder you have mentioned is from Civil & 
Environmental Engineering https://www.ntu.edu.sg/cee/about-us/our-people/faculty/rp00731? I try to 
explain and justify with Hamamatsu accordingly.

Please refer to the following budgetary price for your reference purpose:

OTO Photonics (Please refer to the attached data sheet for your reference purpose) *Note: accessories 
such as cuvette and fibre needs to be purchase together with spectrometer.
-	UVvis-TEC spectrometer / EagleEye model -> EE2063 - USD7,200/unit
-	Deuterium-Halogen Light Source (LS-DH) -> LS-DH-2 – USD2,700/unit
-	2 optical fibers OF-600-100-UVS, again also with any necessary coupling lens & control/analysis 
software if needed.
o	OF-600-100-UVS (optical fibre) – USD350
o	CH-4W (4-way cuvette holder set) – USD390
o	CVT-QAZ (Quartz square cuvette) – USD150

FireflySci (*Note: There will be additional freight charge + handling fee of USD150)
-	48UV10 -> USD320/pce
-	501UV10 -> USD340/pce

Yes, that is correct, the list & details are OK.
Since we don’t even a complete project proposal yet, let alone an on-going approved project, obviously 
there has been no work done and hence no publication! But the 2nd attached paper is authored by prof. 
Snyder, who is now a prof. in NTU and who will also participate in the project. I hope this is OK.          
               Thank you once again and am looking forward for your quotation(s).
       With best wishes,
               Daniel

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for getting back with the details and information. I have summarised the details accordingly 
and also for your requested products below. Regarding the written article as requested for Japan export 
screening. Do you have any article which has been written by either yourself or from any one in NTU EEE 
relating to this application? This is usually requested by Hamamatsu for their screening process.

- Model Number: S1227-1010BQ, S12698-02, S1337-21, S4114-46Q, S5973-01, S12271, S9295, S3477-
04, S8553, S15249
- Quantity: 2-6pcs each
- Application: Water quality assessment and monitoring using UV absorption as well as fluorescence.
- End User: NTU
- End User Country: Singapore
- End User Website: https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee

Ocean Insight 
-	STS-UV, STS-VIS and 
-	OCEAN-HDX-UV-VIS, including 2 coupling optical fibers and any necessary coupling lens & 
control/analysis software if needed.

OTO Photonics 
-	UVvis-TEC spectrometer
-	EagleEye model EE2063, 
-	Deuterium-Halogen Light Source (LS-DH), and 
-	2 optical fibers OF-600-100-UVS, again also with any necessary coupling lens & control/analysis 
software if needed.

FireflySci
-	48UV10
-	501UV10
-	A custom-made flow cell, as shown in the drawing in the left attached image below. 
o	The dimensions are: L= 50 mm, W = 25 mm; H = 5?....8? mm. The wall thickness can be 
chosen as dictated by the fabrication considerations. The H value will probably also be 
dictated by manufacturing practical considerations, because the inside chamber will have 
a height h = H-2t, where t is the thickness of the quartz material which obviously cannot 
be reduced below a certain minimal value, which I am not sure what would be in their 
case: 1.5 mm? If we assume 1.5 mm to be indeed the minimal quartz wall thickness 
value then I believe that a minimal overall height of ~6…7 mm is feasible. As is shown in 
the drawing, ideally we would like 3 of the lateral walls (all of which normally would be 
smoothly polished and transparent) to be (after polishing) covered with an UV-enhanced 
Al coating which can serve as a good quality mirror for both most of the UV and visible 
ranges. For such mirrors usually the critical part is extending the reflectivity in the UV, 
hence the indicated value of minimal reflectivity for the coating of Rmin>80% @ the 
wavelength of 235 nm, because usually the reflectivity just gradually increases at larger 
wavelengths and remains relatively high throughout the visible range. The flow cell can 
be made either like a 501 type (i.e. with the inlet/outlet colinear with the flow cell itself), or 
as a 48 type (i.e. the inlet/outlet will be normal onto one facet, in this case obviously the 
non-covered facet, but in this case clearly the entire length of the cell will need to be 
increased to include the size necessary for the inlet & outlet themselves), which is 
considered to be best for manufacturing and assembly (see next). 
o	Finally, the price in the quotation should be for a final product that should include not just 
the custom flow cell but also its immediate fluidic connections to the inlet & outlet. In 
other words, it should look similar to the item shown in the right attached image below, 
i.e. it is better if they can do also do the coupling of inlet & outlet  to tubing themselves so 
that we do not damage them or the delicate quartz flow cell and we can easily use it 
directly and connect it to any other tubing as required (and this way the inlet/outlet are 
also better protected during shipping & subsequent handling). The dimensions (LWH) are 
not very critical. If it is considered that for handling and safety considerations -e.g. for 
proper subsequent polishing without breaking it apart, and/or to be able to properly screw 
tightly the metal connectors to the tubing at the end- at least one of the initial sizes needs 
to be modified (e.g. H needs to be increased, say to a minimal value of 9 mm), then sure, 
no problem.

 

DOWA
-	UF1VL-1H321 & UF4VL-1H321
-	308-FL-02-G02 & 340-FL-02-G02
-	Any LEDs with emission at shorter wavelengths, e.g. 280 nm and 235 nm.

Thank you.

Importance: High

                                             Dear Mr. Philip Ong,
               Thank you for your quick reply! I am a bit familiar with Hakuto, actually Mr. Gregory Quek may 
remember me from the past when I bothered him a few times for various quotations.
               Let me quickly address you questions. First, attached you have the filled in declaration file, with 
attached papers as required about clarifying the application/topic of our proposal. Second, as I also 
stated there, please allow me to highlight that at this moment I need only the cost 
information/quotation not a delivery of devices because I am working at the project proposal and I need 
to estimate the total budget. For this I need to compare not only the specs of various devices but also 
their costs in order to select the most suitable one(s) for the project, so right now the question of usage 
of the devices is irrelevant. IF the project will ultimately be approved, then of course the question of 
delivery will become relevant, and in that case certainly I will contact you once we will need device(s) to 
make the setup(s).
   The project proposal itself is about water quality assessment and monitoring using UV absorption as 
well as fluorescence.

- Quantity: The setup may need 2 detectors, one for UV absorption and one for fluorescence, but 
probably we may need to do a few versions of setups, so maybe a safer estimation of most probable 
need would be a possible order of 6 pieces. However, this will not be for ALL the devices I inquired 
about, but only for 2 or 3 of them which ultimately will be selected as optimal. Once the project will 
be approved and the design clarified, I will contact you again when delivery will be needed.
- Application:   Right now no application, only budget estimation for a project proposal. The 
project proposal itself is about water quality assessment and monitoring using UV 
absorption as well as fluorescence (see attached papers).

Since you mentioned you are also distributor for other companies I also am interested in the following 
products, so I hope it is possible you can also give me quotation(s) for these products:
-	From Ocean Optics (which now is Ocean Insight – BTW your link is not correct: any browser I use 
gives a warning that the site is not secure): the spectrometers STS-UV, STS-VIS and OCEAN-HDX-
UV-VIS, including 2 coupling optical fibers and any necessary coupling lens & control/analysis 
software if needed. 
-	From OTO Photonics: the UVvis-TEC spectrometer EagleEye model EE2063, Deuterium-Halogen 
Light Source (LS-DH), and 2 optical fibers OF-600-100-UVS, again also with any necessary 
coupling lens & control/analysis software if needed
-	From FireflySci: they have quartz flow cells and I am interested in a few. I would like to ask you 
to please kindly give me the prices of the following flow cells (ALL made of UV quartz) in a 
quotation: 
o	48UV10
o	501UV10
o	A custom-made flow cell, as shown in the drawing in the first attached jpg image. The
