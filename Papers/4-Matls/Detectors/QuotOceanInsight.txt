Dear Prof Poenar Daniel, 

Attachment is the quotation for your reference.

Currently the QEPRO delivery time will be 8 weeks due to global shortage of sensor.

The rest still within 4 weeks.

I also include the collimating lens in the quote as optional item, this will help collect the signal into the 
fiber.

Thank you very much
Best Regards

       Dear Lady/Sir,
       My name is Poenar Daniel and I am an Assoc. Prof. in the School 
of Electrical & Electronical Engineering (EEE) of the Nanyang Technology 
University (NTU), Singapore.
              I am now working on a project proposal for whose budget 
configuration I need to quickly gather quotations for the required 
devices. The project proposes to build a water quality assessment unit 
using fluorescence and UV absorption/transmission.
  
Specifically, I saw on the website the spectrometers STS-UV and QE-Pro 
(for high sensitivity) for which I would like to know the price. 
Additionally, if you have bundles of optical fibers with transmission in 
the UV-Vis (with excellent transmission from 250 nm up to ~700 nm) 
which can feed the light into these spectrometers, please also them in 
the quotation. Also, if necessary, add in the quotation the cost for 
training & shipping.
               Thank you for your time and consideration and am looking 
forward for your very quick feedback.
               With best wishes,
               Poenar Daniel
