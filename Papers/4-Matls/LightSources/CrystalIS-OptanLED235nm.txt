Dear Poenar Daniel,

Thank you for inquiring our product.
I am Shogo Sueyoshi, I am Marketing manager of UVC LED, belonging to Asahi Kasei Corporation, 
which is a parent company of Crystal IS.

Regarding 235nm, this is still under development, but we certainly have SMD 235nm product.
Unfortunately, we don’t have any option such as Ball-lens, type.

Attached file is the provisional datasheet of 235 UVC LED.
Sample is available, so if you want, I will ask our distributors to quote it.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Shogo Sueyoshi
Sales and Marketing
