Hi Poenar,

Thanks for your enquiry.

For Laser Diode enquiry, it will be taken care by my Tokyo office, for my office in Singapore, we only sell 
UV LED.

I will forward your email to my counterpart in Japan in a short while for Laser diode products.

As for UV LED, now available package as below:

NCSU334B with peak wavelength 280 nm (metal glass material, SMD)
NVSU233B-D4 with peak wavelength 365 nm (metal glass material, SMD) NSHU551C with peak 
wavelength 365 nm (metal lamp through hole type)

Kindly advise how shall we support from here?  You would need some samples to test?

Thanks!
Rgds
SokYee, Nichia

Inquiry :

Dear Lady/Sir, 
My name is Poenar Daniel and I am an Assoc. Prof. in the School of Electrical & Electronical Engineering 
(EEE) of the Nanyang Technology University (NTU), Singapore. 	I am now working on a project proposal 
for whose budget configuration I need to quickly gather quotations for the required devices.

I would have contacted directly your Singapore reprezentative but unfortunately you do NOT indicate 
their e-mail.

I would like to request for a quotation for a few of your devices, namely:
LASER DIODES: 
NDU4116 and NDU7216

LEDs: 
NCSU334B with peak wavelength 280 nm
NCSU334B with peak wavelength 330 nm if you have it available (your UV LED catalogue says "under 
development")
NVSU233B-D4 with peak wavelength 365 nm
NSHU551C with peak wavelength 365 nm
NSHU591C with peak wavelength 365 nm

The project proposes to build a water quality assessment unit using fluorescence and UV 
absorption/transmission.

If yuou cannot quote the cost per piece, then of course indicate in the quotation the minimum nr. of 
pieces as required by your company. Also please add in the quotation the cost for the shipment. Thank 
you for your time and consideration, and am looking forward for your quick feedback with the 
quotation! 
With best wishes,
Poenar Daniel
