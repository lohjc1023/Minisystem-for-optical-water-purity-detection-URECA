Hi Daniel,

I will quote using email first as this is only enquiry.

For below product, it is still at design stage, not launched.
NCSU334B with peak wavelength 330 nm -it would be great if you have 
it available (your UV LED catalogue says "under development")


For pricing, you may find below for 3 part numbers:
NCSU334B with peak wavelength 280 nm = US$30/pcs with MOQ 
100pcs 
NVSU233B-D4 with peak wavelength 365 nm = US$30/pcs with MOQ 
100pcs
NSHU551C with peak wavelength 365 nm = US$2.5/pcs with MOQ 
100pcs
NSHU591C with peak wavelength 365 nm = US$2.5/pcs with MOQ 
100pcs

Thanks!

Importance: High

                        Dear Sok Yee,
        Thanks a lot for your quick reply! Also thanks for the kind offer for samples, but for the moment I 
need very urgently to finish the budget in a project proposal, so I need a quotation for the UV LEDs 
mentioned in my list (If possible also for the laser diodes if you can ask your Japan colleagues to make 
the quotation and forward it to me ASAP):
 
LEDs: 
NCSU334B with peak wavelength 280 nm
NCSU334B with peak wavelength 330 nm -it would be great if you have it available (your UV LED 
catalogue says "under development")
NVSU233B-D4 with peak wavelength 365 nm
NSHU551C with peak wavelength 365 nm
NSHU591C with peak wavelength 365 nm
 
I see you mentioned only 2 of these, this means the others are not available?? Please note that their 
availability for purchase & delivery right now is NOT relevant/important for me at this moment, 
because -as I said- right now I just need to do the budget, so I only need to know their prices. The fact 
that you don’t have them in stock now and may need 3 months to order from Japan right now is 
irrelevant for me, I just need to know that you CAN order them and that you please tell me their 
cost/price in a quotation.
 
As mentioned, if you need a certain minimal number of components in the quotation because of your 
internal company guidelines, then of course quote me the minimal number which you need to  have in 
an order, but please make sure you indicate clearly in the quotation that that is the cost of X pieces (not 
per piece). Also, if necessary, please also include in quotation the costs for shipment.
 
        Thank you very much for your kind help and I am looking forward for your quick feedback!
        With best wishes,
        Daniel

Hi Poenar,
 
Thanks for your enquiry.
 
For Laser Diode enquiry, it will be taken care by my Tokyo office, for my office in Singapore, we only sell 
UV LED.
 
I will forward your email to my counterpart in Japan in a short while for Laser diode products.
 
As for UV LED, now available package as below:
 
NCSU334B with peak wavelength 280 nm (metal glass material, SMD)
NVSU233B-D4 with peak wavelength 365 nm (metal glass material, SMD) NSHU551C with peak 
wavelength 365 nm (metal lamp through hole type)
 
Kindly advise how shall we support from here?  You would need some samples to test?
 
Thanks!
Rgds

Inquiry :
 
Dear Lady/Sir, 
My name is Poenar Daniel and I am an Assoc. Prof. in the School of Electrical & Electronical Engineering 
(EEE) of the Nanyang Technology University (NTU), Singapore.    I am now working on a project proposal 
for whose budget configuration I need to quickly gather quotations for the required devices.
 
I would have contacted directly your Singapore reprezentative but unfortunately you do NOT indicate 
their e-mail.
 
I would like to request for a quotation for a few of your devices, namely:
LASER DIODES: 
NDU4116 and NDU7216
 
LEDs: 
NCSU334B with peak wavelength 280 nm
NCSU334B with peak wavelength 330 nm if you have it available (your UV LED catalogue says "under 
development")
NVSU233B-D4 with peak wavelength 365 nm
NSHU551C with peak wavelength 365 nm
NSHU591C with peak wavelength 365 nm
 
The project proposes to build a water quality assessment unit using fluorescence and UV 
absorption/transmission.
 
If yuou cannot quote the cost per piece, then of course indicate in the quotation the minimum nr. of 
pieces as required by your company. Also please add in the quotation the cost for the shipment. Thank 
you for your time and consideration, and am looking forward for your quick feedback with the 
quotation! 
With best wishes,
Poenar Daniel
