                                             Dear Mr. Dan Coursen,
               Thank you for your reply. For the quantity let’s assume I will fabricate 10 devices, and each will need one mosaic, so in total there will be 40 pieces.
               Thank you and am looking forward for your quotation.
               Best wishes,
               Daniel

Hi Daniel,

I have determined it will take 4 pieces to create a 40 x 60mm mosaic. Each circular 50 mm piece will be cut down to 22.5mm x 30mm. Four of those will create your mosaic.

Can you tell me how many of these units you are trying to make? Quantity will affect pricing.

               Then we can stick with the 35 mm size. But please allow me to highlight that for the moment I need just your quotation as at this stage I am putting up a project proposal. This means I do not want to falsely raise your hopes that I would place order very soon, because we are only in a very incipient stage in building up the project proposal and I need the quotation to build the project budget. The assessment and approval of the proposal (once finished and submitted) can be very lengthy (as you can 
expect from a govt. institution), because we will have to wait/secure in succession approvals/signatures & feedbacks from all the levels: Centre director, Division head, Research Chair, School Chair, Research Office, and then the funding institution itself.  But the quotation is absolutely vital because if we don’t use actual recent quotations with which to justify the costs for each of the budget items, the proposal bounces back to us (at each level) until we get them. I even had the not so jolly experience that -
because the entire approval process was so slow- the quotation’s validity expired in each interval while it was en route from one stage to another (i.e. just waaaaaaiting for that signature at a certain level) and I had to repeatedly ask 3 or even 4 times for the same quotations! This was only one incident, usually I didn’t have any other problems and 1 quotation was enough and only sometimes had to ask for a 2nd one. Nevertheless, I thought it is much better to let you know that, just in case I may need to 
bother you again with another quotation request, it is not because I want to waste your (and my) time, simply have to comply to our beaurocratic rules…
               Anyway, for the moment I hope all details are clear, so please kindly provide me quotation.
               Thank you for all your kind efforts and replies and am looing forward for your feedback!
               Best wishes,       
Daniel

Hi Daniel,
 
The largest size we currently produce is 50mm diameter. If your plan is to mosaic these filters to produce a larger size, the largest square you could cut from this piece would be around 35mm. I let you figure out the geometry of how you you want to arrange this. I do have a company near me that can cut the glass to the desired size. I would just need  exact dimensions and tolerances.
 
Let me know how you wish to proceed.

               Thank you for your comments.
       How big is the initial piece that you cut down? Is it a circular filter of diameter of approx. 35.5 mm??
       In order to cover the 45 mm x 60 mm area, a possible option is to ‘mosaic’ it using 4 pieces, each of 25 mm x  32 (or 33) mm to make sure the filter surface is larger than the tube surface. 
However, this could be feasible ONLY if your initial circular piece already has a diameter of 22.7…23.4 mm, or thereabout, hence my question about the size/diameter of the initial (circular?) piece that you need to cut down.
       The quantities/number of pieces can be considered the minimal for which you 
accept  quotation/order. If you can mention per piece is good, if you need say min.10 pieces then you put 10 pieces in the quotation but of course indicate that the cost is for 10 pieces. 
       Just for completitude, I think is better if can please also put in the quotation the cost of the unadulterated (i.e. not cut, as fabricated) filter of the largest size that you have/produce normally (I need to discuss with my collabs if the size of the tubing can be reduced to fit the size of the filter). Also please don’t forget to include the packaging & shipping costs.
       Thank you very much!
                      Best wishes,
                      Daniel

Hi Daniel,
 
I am so sorry for the confusion regarding my last email. You are correct. <1%T in the UV and >90% T in 
the visual.
 
As for the dimensions, you had originally mentioned 12.5 or 25mm square parts; this would be easy to accomplish by cutting down existing parts, thereby keeping your costs down. Increasing the size to 45 x 60mm is problematic as this would take a dedicated run and be much more expensive.
 
I also noticed you never mentioned any quantities in your previous emails.
 
Let me know you thoughts on these things.

               Thank you for your quick reply!
               Just a few gentle remarks, if you allow me. When you said “with less than 1% reflectivity”, I think you actually meant transmissivity T instead. And also I think at the end of the sentence there is something missing after “it would only have around”.
               The curve looks very good!!! Due to the scale on the Y axis one cannot see what is the exact value at the bottom for the very short wavelengths, but I presume that it is the value you wanted to mention in your 1st sentence, I.e. it should be >1% transmissivity T, i.e. R>99%. This latter value means that I implicitly assume that there is no absorption, i.e. whatever is not T should be (almost completely) R, i.e. R+T?1.
               The thickness for the moment is not a problem, since (as you may realize) obviously a few mm extra won’t make a difference as long as the substrate is decently transparent. The exact size is another big problem (among other many things I still have to clarify with my other collaborators!!!) 
but the quartz/fused silica tube that I saw could be ordered may have the dimensions of 15 mm (Height) x 45 mm (Width) x 60 mm (Length). The 1st one is irrelevant for the filter as it will be placed at the bottom (underneath it will be some lens/lenses and the fibres going to detectors), so you can consider that the filter should cover at least an area of 45 mm x 60 mm. If too troublesome to cut, might as well just use the filter as is (easier & simpler for everybody!).
               Thank you once again and am looking forward for your feedback!
               With best wishes,
               Daniel

Hi Daniel,
 
We can produce a filter with less than 1% reflectivity in the UV range, but it would only have around. 
I have attached a theoretical curve for your reference. In order to keep costs down for you, we would be cutting down some larger circular pieces to your dimensions. The only problem I can see is the thickness. the 1" square would be around 6mm thick and the 0.5" square would be 3mm thick. Let me know if this is going to be a problem.
 
Take a look at the curve and tell me if this is acceptable. If it is, I will have a quote to you later today.

                                             Dear Mr. Dan Coursen,   
       I just realized a few other things that I though I should also share with you.
       From what I have seen at other companies on the Net, there are filters with very high transmission all the way from the visible way into the NIR covering even the telecom wavelength of 1.5 microns. Compared to this, my filter’s high transmission band that should cover only up to  800 or 780 nm (or even less, as I stated earlier) is rather puny. Much more critical is to have a very high transmission within this passband, as high as possible, because -as I mentioned- the filter will be used for some fluorescence application and we don’t want to lose anything from the very weak 
fluoresced radiation (which also indicates that the substrate does not need to have good UV qualities but should rather have a bloody high transmission throughout the entire visible range).
       What I found to be extremely difficult instead, was to ensure the reflectivity range to be wide enough and -again- with R high enough. Even a small leakage is undesired not only for safety reasons, or to avoid generating false signals picked by detector, but also because if the substrate is not of UV quality (for the reason stated above and in my previous email) then the UV radiation in time may slowly degrade its optical qualities,. i.e. will break down its chemical composition and its optical transparency will slowly degrade in time.  So the requirements for the SHORT wavelength range -both in terms of VERY HIGH reflectivity and bandwidth (from 230 to 380/400 nm)- are much 
more critical, at least in my opinion – but please let me know if I am wrong/your opinion.
       Anyway, thank you very much for your kind help!
                      Best wishes,
                              Daniel

                                             Dear Mr. Dan Coursen,
               Thank you for your quick reply! Let me given the required info & some background.
               I am now making up a project proposal for investigating trace contaminants in water using fluorescence, and the required filter/dichroic mirror should be part of the system. The filter will therefore be used to block the few UV wavelengths used for excitation and let only the visible light go thru.
               Hence, given that UV should be reflected back, for the substrate I am not sure if a fused silica is necessary and if a simpler/cheaper material, e.g. BK7 could be used instead. The ultimate criterion to be used should then be what material has the highest possible transparency in a wavelength band as wide as possible in the visible range (e.g. 380 to 780 nm), because, as you can imagine, the fluorescence would be quite weak and we don’t want to lose/absorb it. 
               For the moment the size is not critical but the shape should be square or rectangular. About the size, we can go with what you have available within your internal normal procedures/standards: if you have, say, only 12 mm x 12 mm then  please use that. If you have 25 mm x 25 mm (or maybe more correct is to say either 5 inch x 5 inch  or  10 inch x 10 inch, as I don’t think you use the metric system, right?), then consider it (so the larger one to be put in the quotation).
       The other criterion important for you is of course to use a material available at your disposal and to be within your production standards, otherwise the price will most probably sky-rocket and the fabrication will also be complicated for you, and both of course are unwanted.
               I hope this gives you the required clarifications.
               Thank you your time and help!
               Best wishes,
               Daniel

Hi,
 
Thank you for contacting us. I just have a couple of questions before I dive into this. 
 1. What substrate do you want for your filter?
2. What are the physical dimensions of the filter?

                                             Dear Lady/Sir,
               My name is Poenar Daniel and I am an Assoc.Prof. in the EEE School of NTU, Singapore. 
               Since on your website you have no info about your products and no transmission plots vs. wavelength, I would like to know if you have available or if it is possible for you to fabricate a UV-vis long-pass dichroic mirror, although maybe a more appropriate name would be edge filter because the ideal desired operation should be for an AOI of 0°, NOT 45° as is typical with normal applications for dichroic mirrors (e.g. in a filter cube). 
               The specs for this filter are: high reflectivity (R>90%) in the UV (between 230 nm and 380 or400 nm) and high transmissivity (T>90%)  in the visible range (between approx.380 or 400 nm and 750...780 nm).  If the latter is too tough (i.e. too difficult/impossible to reconcile both rejection & transmission windows requirements simultaneously), the vis range transmission window's long wavelength limit can be reduced down to 600 nm or even 550 nm if really necessary.
               If you have/can do it, then please kindly send me a quotation for it, including the cost of 
packaging & shipping.
               Thank you for your help and am looking forward for your quick feedback !
               With best wishes,
               Poenar Daniel
