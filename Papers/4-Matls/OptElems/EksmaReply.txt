                                             Dear Ms. Beatri?e,
               Thank you for your quick reply! Then in this case you can put in the quotation what you can offer/have available (the dichroic filter with the lowest wavelength of 280 nm for the UV reflection region, and the 093-3315-Protected Al mirror), and I will discuss with my other project collaborators.
               Thank you very much for your kind help and am looking forward for your quotation!
               With best wishes,
               Daniel

Dear Daniel Poenar, 

Thank you for your request. Unfortunately, we can only offer broadband coatings from 280 nm. Would you still need a quotation for 093-3315-Protected Al mirror?

Best regards,
Beatri?? Siauryt?

Inquiry:
Dear Lady/Sir,  
I would like to inquire if you have/can design & fabricate a UV-vis long-pass dichroic 
mirror, i.e. with high reflectivity (R>90%) in the UV (between say 230 nm and 400 nm) 
and high transmissivity (T>90%) in the visible range (between approx.380 or 400 nm and 
750...780 nm) (all at normal incidence i.e. AOI=0°.  
If this could be too difficult to design/fabricate, then can relax somewhat the specs, e.g.  
- the AOI can be 45° instead, and/or  
- the wavelengths range could be 250...380 nm for hi R and 380...550 nm for hi T  
 
If it is possible for you to make it, please kindly provide me a quotation (in which you can 
also add the product 093-3315-Protected Al mirror), and also include the packaging & 
shipping costs as well.  
Thank you for your help and am looking forward for your feedback.  
With best wishes,  
Daniel
