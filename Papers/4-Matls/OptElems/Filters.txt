Specs (Our source/LEDs): 235, 255, 275 nm, 340 nm
We need:  UV-vis long-pass dichroic mirror, i.e. with high reflectivity (R>90%) in the UV (between say 230 nm and 400 nm) and high transmissivity (T>90%)  in the visible range (between approx.380 or 400 nm and 750...780 nm)

They also have APDs, but with peak response at 850 nm and very little at 400 nm.

Research Electro-Optics (REO) Inc.’s fabrication technology enables the manufacture of extremely small filters that can be below 1-mm physical dimension and allows the fabrication of linear variable filters as small as 1 × 3 mm on wafer-sized substrates

			Dear Lady/Sir,
	My name is Poenar Daniel and I am an Assoc.Prof. in the EEE School of NTU. I would like to know if you have available or if it is possible for you to fabricate a UV-vis long-pass dichroic mirror, although maybe a more appropriate name would be edge filter because the ideal desired operation should be for an AOI of 0°, NOT 45° as is typical with normal applications for dichroic mirrors (e.g. in a filter cube). 
	The specs for this filter are: high reflectivity (R>90%) in the UV (between 230 nm and 380 or400 nm) and high transmissivity (T>90%)  in the visible range (between approx.380 or 400 nm and 750...780 nm).  If the latter is too tough (i.e. too difficult/impossible to reconcile both rejection & transmission windows requirements simultaneously), the vis range transmission window's long wavelength limit can be reduced down to 600 nm or even 550 nm if really necessary.
	If you have/can do it, then please kindly send me a quotation for it, including the cost of packaging & shipping.
	Thank you for your help and am looking forward for your quick feedback !
	With best wishes,
	Poenar Daniel
P.S.: What is not transmitted should be reflected & viceversa, i.e. ideally no absorption at all wavelengths.
