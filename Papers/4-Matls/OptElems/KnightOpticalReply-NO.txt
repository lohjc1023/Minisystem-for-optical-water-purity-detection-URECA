Dear Lady/Sir, My name is Poenar Daniel and I am an Assoc.Prof. in the EEE School of 
NTU. I would like to know if you have available or if it is possible for you to fabricate a 
UV-vis long-pass dichroic mirror, although maybe a more appropriate name would be 
edge filter because the ideal desired operation should be for an AOI of 0°, NOT 45° as is 
typical with normal applications for dichroic mirrors (e.g. in a filter cube). The specs for 
this filter are: high reflectivity (R>90%) in the UV (between 230 nm and 380 or400 nm) 
and high transmissivity (T>90%) in the visible range (between approx.380 or 400 nm and 
750...780 nm). If the latter too tough (i.e. too difficult/impossible to reconcile both 
rejection & transmission windows requirements/bandwidths simultaneously), the vis 
range transmission window's long wavelength limit can be reduced down from 750/780 
nm to 600 nm or even 550 nm if really necessary. If you have/can do it, then please 
kindly send me quotation for it, including the cost of packaging & shipping. Thank you for 
your help and am looking forward for your quick feedback ! With best wishes, Poenar 
Daniel
Thank you, Knight Optical!
