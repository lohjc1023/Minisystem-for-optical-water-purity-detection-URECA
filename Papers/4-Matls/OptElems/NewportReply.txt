                                             Dear Ms. Christine Wong,
               Thanks for your reply!
               Hehehe, I am not new in NTU, I think you are the 3rd or 4th person I am talking to along the years 
(starting with the 1st one from Oriel more than 20 years ago).
               Dunno abt next week but today, tomorrow & Thursday definitely will be in office, if you can & 
want to drop by. My office is S2.2-B2-06. My tel. is 6790 4237, if you are not familiar with NTU, then can 
just reach the South Spine, e.g. at the entrance in Block S2 and can pick you up from there.
               Thank you and am looking forward for your feedback.
               Best wishes,       
Daniel

Hi Prof Daniel,

Thank you for your enquiry with Newport.

My name is Christine, and I handle NTU account for all of Newport’s and its brands products.

Going forward, you can contact me directly should you have any enquiry.

Are you new in NTU? Perhaps, I can drop by your office to pass you my card and some product 
catalogues next week?

I am checking if we can custom your required filter, but before that, can you let me know the 
dimensions of the filter size required, and quantity? 
 
Thanks.

Web Email:  epdpuiu@ntu.edu.sg  /  Contact Email:  

Case #:  00507394 

Priority:  Medium

Opened:  6/7/2021

Subject:  Interest in a custom product 

Description: Dear Lady/Sir,
              I am an Assoc.Prof. in the EEE School of NTU. I wold like to know if you have avialble or if it is 
possible for you to fabricate a UV-vis long-pass dichroic mirror, although maybe a more appropriate 
name would be edge filter because the ideal desired operation should be for an AOI of 0°, NOT 45° as is 
typical with normal applications for dichroic mirrors (e.g. in a filter cube). 
              The specs for this filter are: high reflectivity (R>90%) in the UV (between 230 nm and 380 or400 
nm) and high transmissivity (T>90%)  in the visible range (between approx.380 or 400 nm and 750...780 
nm).  If the latter too tough, the vis range transmission window's long wavelength limit can be reduced 
down to 600 nm or even 550 nm if really necessary.
              If you have/can do it, then please kindly send me quotation for it, including the cost of packaging 
& shipping.
              Thank you for your help and am looking forward for your quick feedback !
              With best wishes,
